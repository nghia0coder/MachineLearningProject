To address the challenges within the dataset, we will employ two primary methods: linear regression to predict values in the MEDV column (Median value of owner-occupied homes and logistic regression to classify the CHAS variable (Charles River dummy variable).
1. Linear Regression for the MEDV Column:
- We will utilize linear regression to build a model for predicting the average value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) based on various features of suburban areas. This model can offer a comprehensive understanding of how different factors influence housing prices.
2. Logistic Regression for the CHAS Variable
- For the CHAS variable, we will use logistic regression to construct a classification model for proximity to the Charles River. This model will help us gain insights into how geographical factors, such as location, may impact the likelihood of an area bordering the Charles River.
